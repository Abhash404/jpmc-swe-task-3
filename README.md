# JPMC Task 3

Display data visually for traders. Use Perspective to create the chart for the traderâ€™s dashboard.

# Aim:
Use Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor this trading strategy. Basically, you have to modify the existing live chart to be able to (1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices (2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio (3) and finally, show 'alerts' whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio.

# recommended version:
node v18.10.0 and npm v6.4.1

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.

# Known Issues:
Some users seem to be having trouble with the unzipped version of the node_modules back up for windows. This is the alternative unzipped version: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wzIlt-OeiK6nYEHidsOGlpJ_KmeoPVXz

# Note:
You may need to (hard) refresh the link to the public gdrive to see all of the files/folders e.g. @jpmorganchase/perspective as it takes g drive a bit to load them for you.
